\section{Suggestion of Work}
In this work I want to analyze the current state of Unknown Horizon's\footnote{Unknown Horizons website:
\url{http://www.unknown-horizons.org}} game architecture. The architecture is currently very dependent on
multiple inheritance and is not fully data driven. I want to analyze other (open source) games and see how they work on
this task. Ideas would be: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Battle of Wesnoth\footnote{Battle of Wesnoth website: \url{http://www.wesnoth.org}}
	\item 0 A.D.\footnote{0 A.D. website: \url{http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/}}
	\item Glest\footnote{Glest website: \url{http://glest.org/en/index.php}}.
\end{enumerate}

All three games would fit considering there genre, so they are at least in parts comparable to Unknown Horizons. 

After analyzing all four games, I will try to find out the pros and cons for every architecture and see if I can find
any useful ideas to port to Unknown Horizons. I will then see if I can implement at least some of the gained knowledge
in Unknown Horizons and write a report about how well that went.

A possible outline:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction
	\item Unknown Horizons - InGame object Architecture Analysis
	\item Battle of Wesnoth - InGame object Architecture Analysis
	\item 0 A.D. - InGame object Architecture Analysis
	\item Glest - InGame object Architecture Analysis
	\item Summary of Ideas found in Literature 
	\item Comparison of results
	\item Implementation of a Component-Based architecture in Unknown Horizons
	\item Results
	\item Summary
\end{enumerate}
